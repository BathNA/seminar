PDE-constrained optimization problems have a wide range of applications across
numerical mathematics and applied science, so it is important to develop fast
and feasible methods to solve such problems. We employ preconditioned iterative 
methods to tackle the large and sparse matrix systems that arise from their
discretization, and consider a range of issues related to these solvers. In
particular, we discuss applications of reaction-diffusion control problems,
strategies for handling additional box constraints on the PDE variables,
approaches for problems involving fractional derivatives, and deferred
correction methods for time-dependent problems.
