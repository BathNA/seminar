We consider evolutionary partial differential equations. We are interested in approximating a (time-dependent) functional of the solution rather than the solution itself. This may for example be the spatial average of the solution (as a function of time). We consider connections to numerical linear algebra (in particular: the approximation of the solution of a Lyapunov equation) and to numerical integration (in particular: the numerical integration of analytic functions).
