Inverse problems are ubiquitous in many areas of Science and Engineering and, once discretised, they lead to ill-conditioned linear systems, often of huge dimensions: regularisation consists in replacing the original system by a nearby problem with better numerical properties, in order to find meaningful approximations of its solution. In this talk we will explore the regularisation properties of many iterative methods based on Krylov subspaces. After surveying some basic methods such as CGLS and GMRES, innovative approaches based on flexible variants of CGLS and GMRES will be presented, in order to efficiently enforce nonnegativity and sparsity into the solution.
