We describe a simple, fast algorithm for evaluating a
Volterra convolution integral operator at N points of a grid with
a cost that is almost linear in N.  By comparison, the cost is
quadratic in N using the obvious approach.  The fast algorithm
requires the kernel k(t) to be approximated by a sum of terms
of the form w exp(-at) for t in a compact interval bounded away
from zero.  This type of nonlinear approximation has proved useful
for implementing nonreflecting boundary conditions for wave
equations.  I will describe a more recent application to fractional
PDEs, and a new method for deriving the necessary exponential sum
approximation.
