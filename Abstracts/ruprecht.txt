Spectral deferred corrections (SDC) are an iterative approach to constructing time integrators of high order. They can be considered either as a framework for generating high order schemes out of a low order base method or as iterative solvers for the stages of collocation methods. In my talk, I will present two new integration methods based on the SDC framework. One is based on the second order Verlet-type Boris integrator which is widely used to compute trajectories of charged particles in electro-magnetic fields. The resulting Boris-SDC allows to generalise the intrinsically second order Boris method to arbitrary high order. Accuracy and long-term energy error will be discussed for single particles and particle clouds. The other method is SDC with fast-wave slow-wave splitting (fwsw-sdc). Here, an implicit-explicit Euler is used as based method, treating stiff, fast acoustic waves implicitly and slower modes explicitly. Stability, convergence and dispersion properties are analysed and compared against diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) and IMEX methods.
