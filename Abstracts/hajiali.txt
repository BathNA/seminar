Multi-index methods are a generalization of multilevel methods in high dimensional problem and are based on taking mixed first-order differences along all dimensions. With these methods, we can accurately and efficiently compute a quadrature or construct an interpolation where the integrand requires some form of high dimensional discretization. Multi-index methods are related to Sparse Grid methods and the Combination Technique and have been applied to multiple sampling methods, i.e., Monte Carlo, Stochastic Collocation and, more recently, Quasi Monte Carlo.

In this talk, we describe and analyse the Multi-Index Monte Carlo (MIMC) and Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation (MISC) methods for computing statistics of the solution of a PDE with random data. Provided sufficient mixed regularity, MIMC and MISC achieve better complexity than their corresponding multilevel methods. We propose optimization procedures to select the most effective mixed differences to include in these multi-index methods. We also observe that in the optimal case, the convergence rate of MIMC and MISC is only dictated by the convergence of the deterministic solver applied to a one-dimensional spatial problem. We finally show the effectiveness of MIMC and MISC in some computational tests, including PDEs with random coefficients and Stochastic Particle Systems.
