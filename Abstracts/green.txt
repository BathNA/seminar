Given some experimental data, we often want to estimate the unknown parameters
behind it. Sometimes however, all we really want to know is whatâ€™s going to
happen next?
In this talk, we follow the 2013 SIAM review paper by Chad Lieberman and Karen
Willcox and look at how the inference-for-prediction method incorporates the
end goal into the inference process, sacrificing parameter estimation accuracy
for online efficiency.
We shall investigate the motivation behind Goal-Oriented Inference and the
control theoretic inspiration of Balanced Truncation, before looking at both a
traditional method for these parameter dependent problems and the
inference-for-prediction method.
