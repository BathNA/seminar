I will describe the development of a new code aimed at the study of hydrodynamical processes in stellar interiors. Current understanding of the evolution of stellar interiors relies on one-dimensional calculations. Complex physical processes which drive this evolution, such as convection, rotation, or accretion, are described by simplified, phenomenological approaches. However, the predictive power of these methods is severely hindered by the many free parameters employed by them. In an effort to redress this situation the Multi-dimensional Stellar Implicit Code (MUSIC) has been developed. By solving the equations of hydrodynamics in spherical coordinates the multi-dimensional processes at the heart of stellar evolution can be studied directly. The use of time-implicit methods allows the specific time-scale of interest to be targeted, and for statistically meaningful quantities of data to be gathered. Recent results from two applications will be presented. Firstly accretion onto a young stellar object is examined, and it's impact for one-dimensional calculations discussed. Secondly the problem of convective overshooting and its influence on lithium depletion is explored.
