            The Numerical Analysis seminar at Bath has been running
            continuously since 1986 and features a range of invited
            talks from distinguished visitors as well as internal talks
            by staff and students of Mathematical Sciences and other
            Departments at the University of Bath. <br>
            <br>
            <hr> <br>
            The Bath Numerical Analysis Seminar takes place Fridays at <b>12.15</b>
            in <b>4W1.7</b> (also known as the Wolfson Lecture
            Theatre). Campus maps can be found <a

            <h4>How to get to Bath</h4>
            See <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/getting-here/">here</a>
            for instructions how to get to Bath. Please email Eike  
            (address below) if you intend to come by car and
            require a parking permit for Bath University Campus for the
            day.
            <h4>Tips for new students on giving talks</h4>
            Since the audience of the NA seminar contains both PhD
            students and staff with quite wide interests and
            backgrounds, the following are some guidelines/hints to make
            sure people don't give you evil looks at lunch afterwards. <br>
            <br>
            Before too much time passes in your talk, ideally the
            audience should know the answers to the following 4
            questions:
            <ul>
              <li>What is the problem you're considering? </li>
              <li>Why do you find this interesting? </li>
              <li>What has been done before on this problem/what's the
                background? </li>
              <li>What is your approach/what are you going to talk
                about? </li>
            </ul>
            There are lots of different ways to communicate this
            information. One way, if you're doing a slide show, could be
            for the first 4 slides to cover these 4 questions; although
            in this case you may want to revisit these points later on
            in the talk (e.g. to give more detail). <br>
            <br>
            Remember:
            <ul>
              <li>"vertebrate style" (structure hidden inside - like the
                skeleton of a vertebrate) = good for detective stories,
                bad for maths talks. </li>
              <li>"crustacean style" (structure visible from outside -
                like the skeleton of a crustacean) = bad for detective
                stories, good for maths talks. </li>
            </ul>
